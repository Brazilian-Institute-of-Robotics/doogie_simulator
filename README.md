# **Simulators Supported**

### Gazebo

- [doogie_gazebo] : ROS package with all launchfiles required to simulate Doogie Mouse in Gazebo

# **Installation**

<!-- ### 1. Installation from Packages:

TODO

    sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-...


or you could also build this repository from source. -->

### Building from Source:

Attention, if you haven't installed [ROS] yet, please check [Ubuntu install of ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu). Desktop-Full Install is the recommended one in order to work with this repository.    

**Building:**

First, lets create a catkin workspace.

    mkdir -p ~/doogie_ws/src

**doogie_simulator** depends on [doogie_base] metapackage. So let's clone it inside our workspace source and install it.

	cd ~/doogie_ws/src
	git clone http://github.com/doogie-mouse/doogie_base.git
    cd ..
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

Then, clone **doogie_simulator** also in your workspace source.
        
    git clone http://github.com/doogie-mouse/doogie_simulator.git

Now, just build your catkin workspace.

    cd ~/doogie_ws
    catkin_make

Don't forget to source your workspace before using it.
    
    source devel/setup.bash


## Example of Usage

### Launch Doogie Mouse at Gazebo:

There are two launch files in simulation. The first one is to run the solver application. The second launch the simulation to send manual goals to the robot.

To launch de solver application, run

	roslaunch doogie_gazebo sim_solver_application.launch

and to start the simulation, publish the actual pose of the robot in the maze
```sh
rostopic pub -1 /doogie/doogie_pose doogie_msgs/DoogiePose "orientation:
  direction: 1
position:
  row: 0
  column: 0" 
```

To launch the move base interface, run
```sh
roslaunch doogie_gazebo sim_move_base_interface.launch
```

To fill the first cell wall on rviz maze visualization, repeat the step above to publish the initial pose of the robot. Thus to move the robot, just send manually the goals (see [DoogieMove.action] to understand the goal message)
```sh
rostopic pub /doogie/move_base_action_server/goal doogie_msgs/DoogieMoveAcnGoal "header:
  seq: 0
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: ''
goal_id:
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  id: ''
goal:
  direction: 0
  cells: 1
  turns: 0"
```

It is also possible send the goals by the axclient interface
```sh
rosrun actionlib axclient.py /doogie/move_base_action_server/goal
```

# **Purpose of the Project**

Doogie Mouse platform was originally developed in 2019 as an undergraduate thesis (Theoprax methodoly) at Centro Universit√°rio SENAI CIMATEC in partnership with Brazillian Institute of Robotics, for teaching principles of artificial intelligence using high level framework for writing and reusing robot software.

It's a [open source project](/LICENSE) and expects modifications and contributions from it's users.
